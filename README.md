# Bluefruit-GameJam-2023 - ElixirMix


ElixirMix is a game I worked on as part of a four week game jam. The theme being Alchemy.

The game focuses on a master alchemist and their apprenntice, who are on a search for the Elixir of Immortality.

They have chosen the approach of mixing ingredients (colours) randomly, believing that they will eventually 
stumble upon the optimal mixture, and attain the sought after Elixir of Immortality. 


## Details

- Unity Engine
- Mixture of hand-drawn and AI-generated assets.
